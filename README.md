Based on the findings of the European transport R&D project INDRIS \(Inland Navigation Demonstrator for River Information Services\) and the German project ARGO in 2001, both the Danube and the Rhine Commissions adopted an Inland Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems \(ECDIS\) standard for Inland Electronic Navigational Chart \(IENC\) data and system requirements for the Rhine and the Danube Rivers. In 2001, the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations \(UN ECE\) adopted the Inland ECDIS Standard as a recommendation for the European inland waterway system \(CCNR 2002\). In 2003 the European R&D-project COMPRIS \(Consortium Operational Management Platform River Information Services\) organized a North American - European Inland ENC Workshop. One key objective was to discuss the benefits of harmonizing Inland ENC data standards between Europe and North America. The Inland ENC Harmonization Group \(IEHG\) was formed in 2003 to facilitate the development of international standards for Inland ENC data. The IEHG is comprised of representatives from government, industry and academia. European participants take part on behalf of the European Inland ECDIS Expert Group. The North American participants are members of the North American Inland ENC Ad Hoc working group that was formed in 2002. Russia has joined the IEHG in 2004, Brazil in 2007, China in 2009, South Korea in 2010 and Venezuela and Peru in 2011. In 2009 the [International Hydrographic Organisation \(IHO\)](http://iho.int/srv1/index.php?lang=en) has recognized IEHG as Non-Governmental International Organization \(NGIO\).
