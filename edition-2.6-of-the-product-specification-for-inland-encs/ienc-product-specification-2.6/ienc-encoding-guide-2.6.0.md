# IENC Encoding Guide 2.6.0

The IENC Encoding Guide was developed by the Inland ENC Harmonization Group (IEHG). The intent of the document is to provide detailed guidance on what is required to produce a consistent, uniform Inland ENC.

For all object classes, attributes, and attribute values that are used in conjunction with an Inland ENC, the Encoding Guide - provides a basis for its creation, - describes its relationship to the real-world entity, - provides criteria for its proper use and - gives specific encoding examples

The Inland ENC Encoding Guide is applicable in North and South America, Russia and Europe. It is intended, that the IENC Encoding Guide meets the basic needs for Inland ENC applications worldwide.

Version 2.6.0 has been adopted by IEHG on 15th October 2024.
